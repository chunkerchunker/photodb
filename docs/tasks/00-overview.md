# PhotoDB Implementation Tasks Overview

This document provides an overview of all implementation tasks for the PhotoDB personal photo indexing pipeline.

## Project Structure

The implementation is broken down into the following major components:

1. **Project Setup** - Initial project configuration, dependencies, and environment setup
2. **Database Layer** - SQLite database schema and connection management
3. **CLI Application** - Command-line interface and argument parsing
4. **File Discovery** - Directory scanning and new photo detection
5. **Photo Processing Pipeline** - Core processing stages
   - Stage 1: Photo normalization and resizing
   - Stage 2: Metadata extraction
6. **Supporting Utilities** - Common utilities and helpers
7. **Testing Infrastructure** - Unit and integration tests

## Implementation Order

Tasks should be implemented in the following sequence to ensure proper dependencies:

1. `01-project-setup.md` - Set up project structure and dependencies
2. `02-database-setup.md` - Implement database schema and connection
3. `03-cli-structure.md` - Create CLI framework
4. `04-image-formats.md` - Image format handling utilities
5. `05-file-discovery.md` - Directory scanning logic
6. `06-photo-normalization.md` - Stage 1 implementation
7. `07-metadata-extraction.md` - Stage 2 implementation
8. `08-testing.md` - Testing infrastructure

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Package Manager**: UV for Python dependency management
- **Database**: SQLite with proper schema versioning
- **Image Processing**: Pillow for image manipulation, pillow-heif for HEIC support
- **CLI Framework**: Click or argparse for command-line interface
- **Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests

## Development Workflow

1. Each task can be developed independently once its dependencies are complete
2. All code should include proper error handling and logging
3. Each stage should be idempotent and support force reprocessing
4. Database operations should use transactions for consistency
5. All paths should handle both absolute and relative configurations

## Success Criteria

- Pipeline can process directories of mixed image formats
- Each stage can detect and skip already-processed photos
- Force flag allows reprocessing when needed
- Proper logging and error reporting throughout
- Comprehensive test coverage for critical paths
